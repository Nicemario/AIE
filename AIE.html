<h1>Artifical Intelligence: Explaination</h1>
<p>Hello, this is me Nicemario. Today we're talking about Artificial Intelligence</p>
<h1>What's Artifical Intelligence?</h1>
<p>Artifical Intelligence, or everyone also called AI, it is the capacity of a machine to simulate human intelligence, 
allow it to complete tasks that normally would require human intervent, like learning, solving problems, take decisions and recognise schemes.</p>
<h1>Why the AI is so important?</h1>
<p>There are some types of artifical intelligence that exists more of 50 years, but the progress of the power of computers, 
the disponibility of huge quantities of dates and the development of new algorithms have taked big jumps forward in technology in the last years.
The Artifical Intelligence is the central for the digital trasformation of the society and it becomed one of the priority of the Europan Union.
Future applications could take big changes, but we don't forget that the artifical intelligence is already present in our lives.</p>
<h1>Type of Artifical Intelligences:</h1>
<p>Software:
Virtual assistants, image analysis software, search engines, facial and voice recognition systems.
Incorporated Intelligence:
Robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, things of ethernet.

Artifical Intelligence in the life of all days:
There are many applications that are using artifical intelligence, without us realizing it.

Online Shopping and Advertising:
Artificial intelligence is largily used to supply based suggestions, for example, on previous purchases, on researches and on other behaviors recorded online. 
Artifical Intelligence is also much used on commerce in detail, to optimise the inventories and organise supplies and logistics.

Online researches:
Search engines learn from a big number of dates, provided by users, to offer relevant search results.

Personal digital assistants:
Smartphones use artifical intelligence to offer a product as personalized as possible. 
Virtual assistants answers to questions, provide suggestions and help to organize the agend of many owners of smartphone.

Automatic translation:
Software of automatic translation, based on audio or written texts, use artifical intelligence to supply and improve translations. Another use are automatic subtitles of videos.

Smart homes, cities and infrastructure:
Smart thermostats learn our behaviors to optimize energy. Artificial intelligence can be used in cities to improve traffic flow and reduce traffic jams.

Vehicles:
Even though self-driving cars are still rare, the cars we drive already have some safety features that use artificial intelligence. 
For example, the European Union has helped fund VI-DAS, sensors that detect potential dangerous situations and accidents. Navigation is also largely dependent on artificial intelligence.

Cyber Security:
Artificial intelligence systems can help recognize and combat cyber attacks and threats. 
They do this by learning from the continuous flow of data, recognizing trends and reconstructing how previous attacks occurred.

Artificial Intelligence in the Fight against COVID19:
In the case of the COVID19 epidemic, AI is being used for temperature checks in public places. In medicine, 
it is being used to recognize infections from CT scan images of the lungs. AI can also be used to provide data on the progression of the epidemic.

Fighting disinformation
There are artificial intelligence applications that are able to identify fake news and disinformation, analyzing social media content and identifying suspicious words and expressions, 
because they are sensationalistic or alarming. They can thus help understand which sources can be considered authoritative. Read more about how MEPs are shaping data legislation to foster innovation and ensure security at the same time.

More examples of the use of AI
AI has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of daily life and the economy. Here are some examples.

Health
Researchers are investigating how AI can be used to analyse large amounts of medical data and discover correspondences and patterns to improve diagnosis and prevention.

Researchers have developed an emergency call responder program that can recognise cardiac arrest faster than a human operator. The EU-funded KConnect project is developing multilingual text search tools 
that would make it easier to find the most relevant medical information available.

Transport
AI could improve the safety, speed and efficiency of rail traffic, including through the use of autonomous driving.

AI in factories
AI could help European manufacturers become more efficient. The use of robots could help bring factories back to Europe. AI can also be used to plan sales channels or maintenance.

SatisFactory, a research project co-founded by the EU, uses collaborative systems and augmented reality to increase worker satisfaction in smart factories

Agriculture and food supply chain
AI can be used to build a sustainable food system in Europe. By minimising the use of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation, helping productivity and reducing environmental impact, AI can help produce healthier food. 
For example, robots can be used to remove weeds, thus reducing the use of herbicides.

Many farms in the EU already use AI to monitor the movements, temperature and feeding of livestock.

Public administration and services
By using data to develop models, AI can provide an early warning system for natural disasters, recognising early signs based on past experiences. This would allow for prevention and preparedness for disaster response.</p>
